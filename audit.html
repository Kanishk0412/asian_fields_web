        <p>Environmental auditing is a systematic, documented, periodic and objective process in assessing an organization's activities and services in relation to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assessing compliance with relevant statutory and internal requirements</li>
            <li>Facilitating management control of environmental practices</li>
            <li>Promoting good environmental management</li>
            <li>Maintaining credibility with the public</li>
            <li>Raising staff awareness and enforcing commitment to departmental environmental policy</li>
            <li>Exploring improvement opportunities</li>
            <li>Establishing the performance baseline for developing an Environmental Management System (EMS)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Conducting an environmental audit is no longer an option but a sound precaution and a proactive measure in today's heavily regulated environment. Indeed, evidence suggests that EA has a valuable role to play, encouraging systematic incorporation of environmental
            perspectives into many aspects of an organisation's overall operation, helping to trigger new awareness and new priorities in policies and practices.

        <h1>Why Environmental Audit is needed?</h1>
        <p>
            <b><i> Environmental audits </i></b> are necessary to evaluate the impact of industries and their manufacturing on the natural resources. The environmental auditing is an important process to make sure continuous development in the environmental
            management. The environmental auditor appropriately monitors the system for safe disposal of waste in the industries to ensure the safety of the natural resources. It also lessens the interference of the government directly since the environmental
            auditor can examine the required standards and present the report to the government.
            <br> <br> A good environmental auditing system needs a constant effort to monitor and analyze the industrial working system to create the analysis on pollution being generated. The major objective of performing environmental audits is controlling
            the pollution. It also helps in improving the production safety and to making sure the prevention and reduction of the chemical waste. It also provides performance reviews of industrial working facilities and its possible impact on the surroundings.
