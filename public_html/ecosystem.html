                                            <p>Ecosystem restoration means assisting in the recovery of ecosystems that have been degraded or destroyed, as well as conserving the ecosystems that are still intact. Healthier ecosystems, with richer biodiversity,
                                                yield greater benefits such as more fertile soils, bigger yields of timber and fish, and larger stores of greenhouse gases. </p>
                                            <p>Restoration can happen in many ways - for example through actively planting or by removing pressures so that nature can recover on its own. It is not always possible - or desirable - to return an ecosystem to
                                                its original state. We still need farmland and infrastructure on land that was once forest, for instance, and ecosystems, like societies, need to adapt to a changing climate. Between now and 2030, the restoration
                                                of 350 million hectares of degraded terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems could generate US$9 trillion in ecosystem services. Restoration could also remove 13 to 26 gigatons of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
                                                The economic benefits of such interventions exceed nine times the cost of investment, whereas inaction is at least three times more costly than ecosystem restoration.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>All kinds of ecosystems can be restored, including forests, farmlands, cities, wetlands, and oceans. Restoration initiatives can be launched by almost anyone, from governments and development agencies to businesses,
                                                communities, and individuals. That is because the causes of degradation are many and varied, and can have an impact at different scales. For instance, degradation may result from harmful policies such as
                                                subsidies for intensive farming or weak tenure laws that encourage deforestation. Lakes and coastlines can become polluted because of poor waste management or an industrial accident. Commercial pressures
                                                can leave towns and cities with too much asphalt and too few green spaces. Restoring ecosystems large and small protects and improves the livelihoods of people who depend on them. It also helps to regulate
                                                disease and reduce the risk of natural disasters. In fact, restoration can help us achieve all of the Sustainable Development Goals. As long as ecosystems are not degraded, they are a source of wealth for
                                                society. Healthy ecosystems, whether they be forests, rivers and lakes, oceans and coasts, mountains, grasslands, and peatlands, or farmlands and urban landscapes, provide us with ecosystem services, the
                                                numerous benefits that humans and other life forms gain from a well-functioning ecosystem. These include benefits such as food, fiber, medicine, climate regulation, water purification, fresh air, and aesthetic
                                                value.

                                            <p>However, through several decades, having often served short-term economic interests, our actions have resulted in a diminished ability of ecosystems to provide and support both humans and biota in the long term.
                                                Homogenized landscapes, reductions in the productivity of land and aquatic systems, in water quality, and genetic and functional diversity, alongside increasing risks of climate change, the spread of zoonoses,
                                                and episodes of disasters bear witness to a fractured relationship with nature. For India, scaling up ecosystem restoration activities assumes national importance as India is one of the mega biodiverse countries
                                                of the world, holding four of the world's biodiversity hotspots. Owing to its diverse physical and climatic conditions, it accounts for nearly 8% of the recorded species with approximately 47,000 plant species
                                                and over 100,000 animal species. However, the pressure on ecosystems and biodiversity is also immense, as India, within 2.4% of the world's land area, supports 18% of the global human population and accounts
                                                for 15% of the world's livestock.</p>

                                                <li>Pollution: Pollution is one of the main causes of ecosystem destruction. Pollution can deplete resources and drive away from local animal populations. Significant sources of pollution include trash, carbon
                                                    emissions, oil spills, and pesticides.</li>
                                                <li>Climate Change: Climate change continues to play a significant role in the destruction of the ecosystem. Global warming has led to increased temperatures, sea levels, and ocean acidity that disrupt an ecosystem's
                                                    natural balance.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Land Clearing: As human populations increase, so does the need to develop more land. Many ecosystems are destroyed in order to clear land for housing developments and roads, agricultural uses, and raising
                                                    livestock.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Resource Exploitation: Many ecosystems are rich in natural resources like nutrient-rich soil, water, trees and fossil fuels. Excessive efforts to extract these resources like mining, logging and oil drilling
                                                    contribute to ecosystem destruction.

                                                <li>Population Decline: An ecosystem's animals are vital sources of food and population control. Many animal populations are declining due to overfishing and hunting. Animals are often hunted for their valuable
                                                    skins, plumage, horns, and meat.

                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Plant trees: A simple yet effective way to restore the natural environment is to plant trees, in your backyard, as part of a restoration project or on a farm (with the owner's permission of course). The
                                                    aim is not just to plant a seed or sapling, but to ensure it grows to full maturity so you will need to ensure you choose the right tree species for the right spot so it has the best chance of surviving
                                                    and thriving. You will also need to consider maintenance and ongoing care as the tree will need to be watered and protected from wildlife if it is to reach maturity.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Rewild: Rewilding is about letting nature take care of itself to reverse human interference and domestication. This means allowing natural processes and wildlife rhythms to “do its thing” to repair damaged
                                                    ecosystems, restore barren and degraded landscapes and rebuild biodiverse habitats. If you own a farm or acreage, allocate a section for rewilding and watch wildflowers, native plants, birds, insects,
                                                    bees and other animals return to the area.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Volunteer on a restoration project: There are plenty of existing restoration projects already underway and conservation groups are always looking for volunteers so jump online and do a search for one closest
                                                    to you that you can join. Landcare Australia, a grassroots organization dedicated to managing environmental issues, seeks volunteers for local chapters across Australia to restore land and improve biodiversity.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Eat less meat: According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations animal agriculture accounts for roughly 14.5% of the world's greenhouse gases each year. It also uses 83% of farmland,
                                                    generates 60% of food-related emissions is one of the primary drivers of deforestation. So help restore ecosystems by eating less meat.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Simplify your home: Buying fewer clothes and household goods means requiring fewer virgin materials and natural resources. Combine this with the power of shopping second-hand, repairing, repurposing, borrowing
                                                    and reusing and your personal environment impact is greatly reduced - which is a win for the planet.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Support green businesses: From eco-friendly fashion brands specializing in organic cotton essentials to green electricity providers relying on renewables, there are plenty of businesses committed to sustainability
                                                    practices such as eco-friendly and compostable packaging and reducing emissions by purchasing carbon offsets. Patronizing and supporting these companies only encourages more businesses to go green.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Buy organic: Synthetic pesticides and fertilizers applied on farms degrade the soil and impacts the natural environment by killing insects and bees and polluting waterways. Buying seasonal organic produce
                                                    from local growers is not only better for the environment, it also encourages more farmers to grow organic further helping the cause of protecting ecosystems and wildlife.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Donate to conservation groups: If you don't have the time to volunteer, donate to conservation organizations and community groups involved in ecosystem restoration that have proven track records to ensure
                                                    that these efforts produce the outcomes desired.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>Choose green investments: If you have savings or money to invest, make sure to place these funds in fossil-free investments and banks that are committed to green innovations and invest in sustainability-focused
                                                    companies.
                                                </li>
                                                <li> Join or organize a beach clean-up: If you live near the coast, join a local beach clean-up and if there isn't one, organize one and share the event details across your community networks and social media.
                                                    If you don't have the time or energy to organize an event, you can always just go to the beach and just start picking up plastic trash and other bits you find. You never know, you may inspire other beachgoers
                                                    to do the same.
                                                </li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>To create a sustainable restored ecosystem, restoration specialists often need to couple the restoration of plants and animals with that of landscape processes and natural disturbances. Some restored sites are
                                                relatively small and isolated, which can lead to problems associated with fragmented habitats. Populations in smaller and more-isolated habitat patches experience a greater risk of inbreeding, local extinction
                                                of species, and negative edge effects (that is, the effects of one habitat on an adjacent habitat). For example, small, narrow, sinuous patches of forest have greater amounts of edge than larger square or
                                                circular patches. As a result, more of their interiors border other ecosystems, which may increase the forest's exposure to different pests, predators, and weather and climatic conditions than would normally
                                                occur in forests with shorter borders and thus more-insulated interiors. </p>
                                            <p>Ecological restoration, when implemented effectively and sustainably, contributes to protecting biodiversity; improving human health and wellbeing; increasing food and water security; delivering goods, services,
                                                and economic prosperity; and supporting climate change mitigation, resilience, and adaptation. There are Standards for four distinct, but interrelated approaches to the treatment of historic properties—preservation,
                                                rehabilitation, restoration, and reconstruction.</p>
                                            <p>Blending in with existing national programs:
                                                <br> In India, restoration targets are reflected in several of its flagship programs. Directly, the National Afforestation Programme (NAP) is focused on the rehabilitation of degraded forests and afforestation
                                                around forests. Further, the National Mission for a Green India (GIM) under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) is aimed at improving and increasing tree cover as a climate adaptation and
                                                mitigation strategy.</p>
                                            <p>A key focus of the National Biodiversity Action Plan is also to implement strategies for the reduction in rates of degradation, fragmentation and loss of natural habitats. Recognition that natural resources
                                                are intrinsically linked to rural livelihoods is also reflected in flagship schemes like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and the National Rural Livelihood Mission
                                                (NRLM).
                                            </p>
                                            <p>However, in achieving restoration both at pace and at scale, there is a need to overcome the various barriers to large-scale restoration. The UN Decade has identified six primary barriers to scaling restoration.
                                                These include limited awareness of societies of the negative effects of ecosystem degradation and conversely the benefits of investing into restoration; the lack of financing for restoration; shortage of
                                                legislation and policies that incentivize ecosystem restoration; limited technical knowledge and capacity for ecosystem restoration; and limited investment into long-term research.</p>
                                            <p>The recently released State of Finance for Nature 2021 report highlights that investments in nature-based solutions will have to triple by 2030 and increase four-fold by 2050 if we are to resolve planetary crises.
                                                It further recognizes that currently, with public funding making up 86 percent of finance flow into nature conservation and restoration, private sector finance and engagement will have to be significantly
                                                scaled up.</p>
                                            <p>Ecosystem restoration requires everybody's participation Further, while restoration goals have often taken the form of tree plantations, restoration initiatives would need to also provide significant resources
                                                for the conservation and restoration of freshwater, marine, coastal, and other undervalued ecosystems. In realizing restoration at scale, a diverse group of stakeholders including civil society, academic
                                                institutions, women's groups, indigenous communities, youth, farmer's groups, and the marginalized will also need to be a part of Generation Restoration.</p>
                                            <p>Individuals have an integral role to play in ecosystem restoration through right lifestyle choices and raising public awareness on its importance. Some examples of individual action include judicious use and
                                                management of water including rainwater harvesting, waste segregation at source, recycling, planting trees and encouraging plantations of native species, developing and maintaining green spaces, and choosing
                                                nature-inspired housing and energy-efficient solutions.</p>
                                            <p>The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration runs from 2021 to 2030. Specifically, to facilitate global cooperation for the restoration of degraded and destroyed ecosystems. Along with fostering efforts
                                                to combat climate change, safeguard biodiversity, food security, and water supply.</p>
                                            <p>A clean environment is essential for healthy living. Air pollution can cause respiratory diseases and cancer, among other problems and diseases. Water pollution can lead to typhoid, diarrheal diseases, and other
                                                water-related diseases. Therefore, we should keep our environment clean and protected.</p>
